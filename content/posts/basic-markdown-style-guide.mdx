Markdown is powered by [Markdoc](https://markdoc.dev/). This is an example post to demonstrate all the basic markdown syntax. You can author content using the familiar markdown syntax you already know.

## Inline formatting

Bold: This text is bold.

Italics: This text is italics.

Strikethrough: You can strikethrough text.

Inline code: You can add inline code like this const hello = "world".

## Headings

The following HTML \<h2>—\<h6> elements represent five levels of section headings. \<h1> is also available but not recommended since the post title is already a \<h1> element it is not a good practice to have more than one \<h1> elements in a page.

## H2: Heading Two

### H3: Heading Three

#### H4: Heading Four

##### H5: Heading Five

###### H6: Heading Six

## Paragraph

A standalone single paragraph of text.

Paragraphs can be multiline too when they constitute words that make up more than one line, i.e they wrap to the next line. Wow! I am really smart to write two lines of text that makes zero sense.

## Blockquotes

> This is a blockquote. And it's pretty long too. Long enough to wrap to next line. Surely it will wrap.You can use other Markdown syntax like `inline code` within a blockquote.

## Tables

| Month    | Savings |
| -------- | ------- |
| January  | $250    |
| February | $80     |
| March    | $420    |

## List Types

### Ordered List

1. First item
2. Second item
3. Third item

### &#xA;Unordered List

- Another item
- And another item

### Nested list

- Fruit
  - Apple
  - Orange
  - Banana
- Dairy
  - Milk
  - Cheese

## Code Blocks

Syntax highlighting is done using [Bright.js](https://bright.codehike.org). You can choose the theme you want from a wide range of available bright themes.

```html
<!-- title index.html -->
<!-- highlight(4,5) -->
<!-- focus(8) -->
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html lang="en">
  <head>
    <meta charset="utf-8" />
    <title>Example HTML5 Document</title>
  </head>
  <body>
    <p>Test</p>
  </body>
</html>
```
